# CREDIT-CARD-SEGMENTATION

## DATA AVAILABLE:
CC GENERAL.csv

 Limit usage (balance to credit limit ratio),

 Payments to minimum payments ratio etc.

 Advanced reporting: 

 Use the derived KPIs to gain insight on the customer profiles.

 Identification of the relationships/ affinities between services.


 Clustering: Apply a data reduction technique factor analysis for variable reduction technique and a clustering algorithm to reveal the behavioural segments of credit card holders
